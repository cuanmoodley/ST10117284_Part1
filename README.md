would spend studying a specific module per week durinig the semester by

then the user would have to enter details that the program asks for such as
-start date of the semester
-module name 
-module code

-weeks in semester
-number of class hours per week

the user would then need to click ok to add values to the data grid and determine the 
self-studying hours required for that module for that specific week on that date. 
the data would be recorded on the data grid and then the user can continue adding more modules
to the timer to determine study times for other modules
